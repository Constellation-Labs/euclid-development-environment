## Welcome to Euclid Development Environment
# Dependencies
## Docker
* You should have Docker installed
* Check the [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* You need to have **at least 8GB of RAM allocated to Docker**

## Cargo
* Cargo is the Rust package manager
* [Here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) you can check how to install Rust and Cargo

# First Steps

## Understanding the folder structure

With the euclid-development-environment cloned, you'll see the following structure
```
- infra
  - docker
- scripts
  - hydra
  - hydra-update
- source
  - currency-l0
    - genesis
  - currency-l1
  - dag-l1
  - global-l0
    - genesis
  - p12-files
- .env
```
let's see what each of these directories represents:

### Infra
This is the directory that contains all the Dockerfiles and things related to the Docker containers such as ports, IP's, names

### Scripts
Thats the "home" of hydra script, here you'll find the `hydra` and `hydra-update` scripts

### Source
Here is the home of the local codebase, this directories will be filled in ways you build the containers.

Example: let's say that you'll build the container `currency-l0` (it will be explained better below, don't worry), on the directory `source/currency-l0` will be created one folder with the local codebase of the `currency-l0` node

The example above applies to the other containers: `currency-l1`, `dag-l1`, `global-l0`

Inside the source folder, we also have the sub-directory `p12-files`. In this directory, you can provide the custom `.p12` files. This directory already comes with some examples, but they can be overwritten/removes to your own files.

### .env
Here is the environment configuration file, there you can set the `p12` file names and your GITHUB_TOKEN. It's required to fill the GitHub token here to run the `hydra` script

## Hydra scripts options
Run the following command to list all the possibilities of the `hydra` script

```
./hydra -h
```

you should see something like this:

```
USAGE: hydra <COMMAND>

COMMANDS:
  install        Removes the remote git
  build          Build all the containers
  start_genesis  Start all the containers
  stop           Stop all the containers
  destroy        Destroy all the containers
  status         Check the status of the containers
```
TIP: You can use the same `-h` in each command listed above to see the accepted parameters

### Building
Let's start with the `build` command. This command could be used simply this way:
```
./hydra build   
```
This script has some parameters such as `--no_cache` (run without previous cache), `--run` (automatically run after build), `--only` (to build a specifical container), and `--include_dag_l1` (include the dag-l1 layer).

If you provide the `--run` parameter you should see the available URLs at the end of script execution

### Starting
We have the option `start_genesis` to start the containers. This option will fail case you didn't build the containers yet. You can call the option this way:
```
./hydra start_genesis   
```

This script has some parameters such as `--only` (to start a specifical container), and `--include_dag_l1` (include the dag-l1 layer).

You should see the URLs at the end

### Stopping
We have the option `stop` to stop the containers. You can call the option this way:
```
./hydra stop   
```
This script has the parameter `--only` (to stop a specifical container).

### Destroying
We have the option `destroiy` to destroy the containers. You can call the option this way:
```
./hydra destroy   
```
This script has some parameters such as `--only` (to stop a specifical container), and `--delete_local_codebase` (delete your local codebases with containers).

### Status
We have the option `status` to show the containers status. You can call the option this way:
```
./hydra status   
```
This script has the parameter `--show_all` (to include stopped containers at the listing).

### Installing
We have the option `install` to remove the link with remote `git`. You can call the option this way:
```
./hydra install   
```
## Let's build

After understanding the folder structure, we can start build our containers.

*NOTE: Make sure to fill your GITHUB_TOKEN on .env file before start*

Move your terminal to directory `/scripts`, home of the `hydra` script.

```
  cd scripts/
```

We need to install `argc` to run the script, [here](https://github.com/sigoden/argc) is the doc of `argc`

```
cargo install argc
```

Then run the following to build your containers
```
./hydra build
```

After the end of this step, run the following:
```
./hydra start_genesis
```

After the end of `start_genesis`, you should see something like this:
```
Containers successfully built. URLs:
Global L0: http://localhost:9000/cluster/info
Currency L0: http://localhost:9100/cluster/info
Currency L1 - 1: http://localhost:9200/cluster/info
Currency L1 - 2: http://localhost:9300/cluster/info
Currency L1 - 3: http://localhost:9400/cluster/info
Grafana: http://localhost:3000/

```
You can now access the URLs and see that your containers are working properly

You can also call the `hydra` option
```
./hydra status
```

## Monitoring
With the containers building/starting we also build a monitoring tool. You can access this tool at this URL: `http://localhost:3000/`. The initial login and password are:
```
username: admin
password: admin
```
You'll be requested to update the password after your first login

In this tool we have 2 dashboards, you can access them on `Dashboard` section
